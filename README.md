I' ujsing two different (but very similar) fingerprint readers here, an R307 and a slightly different, Adafruit-compatible version. I show here how to enrol fingerprints using the Windows (only) demo program and then read them back on the Arduino to power a small door lock.

You can do everything on the Arduino, of course, but it makes sense to use the Windows' utility IDE first to ensure it all hangs together. I show you how to do this, all very easy once you have chosen a _suitable Arduino UNO to use._

#### Suitable Arduino Uno?
My original attempts at getting my R307 fingerprint reader working (over two years ago) came to nothing. Now, thanks to some comments in the Adafruit article I figured I needed an Arduino UNO with a "proper" USB to Serial converter, such as the ÂµController found on the original Arduino Uno (an ATMega16U2). Luckily, I had an old, possibly cloned version of that board and it all sprang into life, so very easily!

I didn't amend the Adafruit demo sketch for the Arduino to read the fingerprints, other than to power up the door lock if it found a matching fingerprint. There are dozens of different, 12v door locks out there - check what you need and how to fix it before buying one! Also, bear in mind that these locks take quite some current (the small one I used needs just under 400mA).
