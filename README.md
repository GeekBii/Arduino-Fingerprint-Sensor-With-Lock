#### Intro
I'm using two different (but very similar) fingerprint readers here, an R307 and a slightly different, Adafruit-compatible version. I show here how to enrol fingerprints using the Windows (only) demo program and then read them back on the Arduino to power a small door lock. Both fingerprint readers operate **identically**, but have different coloured wires!

You can do _everything_ on the Arduino, of course, but it makes sense to use the Windows' utility IDE *first* to ensure it all hangs together. I show you how to do this, all very easy once you have chosen a _suitable Arduino UNO to use._

#### Suitable Arduino Uno?
My original attempts at getting my R307 fingerprint reader working (over two years ago) came to nothing. Now, thanks to some comments in the Adafruit article I figured I needed an Arduino UNO with a "proper" USB to Serial converter, such as the ÂµController found on the original Arduino Uno (an ATMega16U2). Luckily, I had an old, possibly cloned, version of that board and it all sprang into life, so very easily! So check whether your UNO uses a CH340G (no go) FTDI (might work) or a 16U2 (best solution).

#### Door locks
I didn't amend the Adafruit demo sketch for the Arduino to read the fingerprints, other than to power up the door lock if it found a matching fingerprint. There are dozens of different, 12v door locks out there - check what you need and how to fix it before buying one! Also, bear in mind that these locks take quite some current (the small one I used needs just under 400mA).

The Adafruit library that I used is also in my GitHub so we know that version will work, but it's always worth checking to see whether an updated version is available that might add features, correct bugs or make it compatible with other hardware.
